# Google Homepage Project
---
This project is completed as part of following the Odin Project, a guided self-teaching cirriculum for aspiring web developers.

The challenge for this project was to recreate the Google homepage. I started this project in April 2021. I was able to learn a lot about styling text boxes, aligning image elements, and working wtih flexbox to help make the webpage dynamic. Although the footer isn't a perfect replica of what Google does, I feel that I managed to capture the basic feel and functionality of it.
